               <h3 >about me</h3>
               <p>Hi, I'm Eric. I'm a student at <a href="https://www.brown.edu/">Brown University</a> studying Applied Math-Computer Science. My technical interests are multifarious-I'm passionate
                  about data science and machine learning, though that doesn't preclude my interest in back-end database topics, nor an emerging curiousity for security and computational biology.
               </p>
			   <p>I'm a go-getter - I established my own brand in Chinese-English translations, and always seek out exciting new projects to work on. I'm a hackathon junkie - I meet new people and learn from others while making
			   products that actually have real life applications. I've previously worked with research institutions like the Stanford Institutes of Medicine and Stanford Bioengineering, enterprises like Commvault, and also organizations like NASA.</p>
			   <p>I fervently believe that the best developers are cognizant of class and racial inequity, and attempt to address key disparities in accessibility and representation. 
                  To this end, a number of my projects are aimed at addressing healthcare disparities. I'm also involved in a number of diversity and mental-health campus initiatives, as well as off-campus social enterprises. I'm also an active volunteer
				  at Rhode Island Hospital. 
               </p>
			   <p>I also have a passion for Chinese food and a penchant for ramen. I dabble in knitting, love national parks, and love trying different kinds of tea. I do aerial arts and compete in BJJ - in addition, I love a good game of Overwatch, Project M, or League of Legends. </p>
               <p>For more details, feel free to check out my resume:

                     <p>Air pollution is an almost ubiquitous problem with significant effects on human health, so we sought to better characterize the behavior of quantifiable air pollution. We investigated the 
                        effect of weather on the amount of different fine particulate pollutants in the atmosphere. We used the body of air quality data from OpenAQ, cleaned it, 
                        and paired it with historical weather data. We trained different machine learning classifiers to ultimately predict air quality changes with over 70% accuracy. We used
                        Python for cleaning the data and for the machine learning.

                     <p>Autism spectrum disorders are chronically underdiagnosed in low-income communities. We wanted to address this issue by using different biomarkers to 
                        screen for traits which suggest that a child may be affected by autism. Our efforts were concentrated in two different areas: prosody and facial features.
                        We constructed a model for facial features from a suite of test images scraped from Google Images for 3-5 yr. old boys using the Microsoft Azure Face API. For prosody, we used a suite of videos
                        from Youtube for 3-5 yr. old boys, and constructed classifiers for processed audio data. Javascript was used for the facial biomarkers, and a combination of Python, R, and Matlab were used to
                        analyze prosody.

                        The results are gathered and displayed for whomever created the original poll.

                     <p>dHOPE engages users by keeping track of their DPP (Drain Protection Points) in order to incentivize community members to take initiative in taking care of their local drains. Because these regions often lack the infrastructure to maintain up to date databases for municipal drainage systems, we used a crowdsourcing solution to identify the drains. In order to engage the community with the idea of protecting their local drains, we designed dHOPE to be a fun, interactive experience. Members of the community are awarded points for identifying, confirming, and adopting drains, and a local leaderboard tracks those who contribute the most to the community. In order to provide additional functionality, we also added additional features of a color-coded system and a weather panel to warn of imminent rainfall.
                        dHOPE is built using meteor.js in conjunction with Javascript and HTML. We integrated multiple functionalities, with a MongoDB backend database used to store user and drain information. We implemented the Google Maps API in order to visualize our content and provide interactivity.

                        aggregate-volare novels. Weekly releases and other administrative tasks give me a chance to hone my Chinese (casual and professional) while steadily generating revenue.
